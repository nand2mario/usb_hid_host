# Compact USB HID host FPGA core

nand2mario, 8/2023

Usb_hid_host is a compact FPGA core designed to support USB keyboards, mice and gamepads. It is designed mainly for FPGA retro gaming and computing projects. The most significant advantage is its all-in-one design. It does not require a CPU to work. And it is quite small (<300 LUTs, <250 registers and 1 BRAM block).

To use usb_hid_host, simply add `usb_hid_host.v`, `usb_hid_host_rom.v` and `usb_hid_host_rom.hex` to your project. The module interface in `usb_hid_host.v` should be sufficiently documented to get you started.

Please refer to [usb_hid_host.md](doc/usb_hid_host.md) for a more comprehensive introduction to the design of the core.

## Sample projects

Two sample projects are available to demonstrate the usage of usb_hid_host.

* [For Tang Nano 20K](boards/tang-nano-20k/) (Gowin GW2A FPGA). Gowin IDE project file `usb_hid_proj.gprj` is provided. Simply open it in Gowin IDE and build the project. 
* [For IceSugar-Pro](boards/icesugar-pro/) (Lattice ECP5 FPGA). It comes with a Makefile for the open source Yosys/NextPNR toolchain. 

Connect your USB devices and expect results similar to the following.

Usb_hid_host does not rely on vendor-specific primitives, making it compatible with most FPGAs and boards. If you encounter any problems, please submit an issue.

## Future Improvements

* Handling multiple devices on a single port (USB hubs).
* Support for full-speed devices.
* Testing compatibility with more devices.
